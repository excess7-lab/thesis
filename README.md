# Warm Inflation with $alpha$ atractors
This repository contains the numerical and analytical implementation of 
warm inflation model based on \alpha -attractor potential, aimed at studying 
the impact of dissipative dynamics on cosmological observables.

## Scientific motivation
Warm inflation provides a framework in which radiation production occurs 
during inflation, modyfing both the background dynamics and the generation 
of primordial perturbations.

\alpha attractor models are strongly motivated by supergravity and are known 
for their robust predictions compatible with CMB observations.

The goal of this project is analyze how warm inflationary dynamics alter the
predictions of \alpha-attractor models, focusing on the scalar spectral index
\(n_s\) and the tensor-to-scalar ratio \(r\)
